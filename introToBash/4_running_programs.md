Running a program
=================
To run a program in your `pwd` present working directory (fancy speak for where
you are in the system), you type in `./programname`. You can try to run anything,
but for something to run, you need the file to have the execute [permission](permissions.md) on a
group that applies to you. You are actually running programs when you type `ls` and
`cat`, but you don't need the `./` for them as they are in your path. The "path" is
the list of folders that the terminal will search through to find a matching
program. Common path directories are /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/share/bin
