this is about / the root directory, where all directories start.
not to be confused with /root the home directory of the root user account.
to avoid confusion I will refer to it as /.
there are a few directories that will be in the / they are `/mnt` `/dev` `/proc`
`/bin` `/etc` `/usr` and `/home`

Directory | contents
----------|---------
/mnt      | where you mount devices
/dev      | where all the file representations of devices are
/proc     | where all the process files are
/bin      | system executables
/etc      | configuration files
/usr      | user executables
/home     | home directories of users
