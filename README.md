LearnLinux
==========

Hastily and crudely pulled from [Matthew Vander Hoff's tutorial](https://github.com/vanderh0ff/LearnLinux).

This is my attempt at making an open course that everyone can use to teach friends and colleagues how to learn linux

I want this to be a fun course that isn't intimidating while providing useful
information with a bit of humor thrown in. think good eats with Alton Brown, but
for Linux instead of cooking, or like vim adventure.

for parents, if you're using this course to teach your kids Linux make sure you have a
long talk with them about not staying up for days trying to compile a kernel
